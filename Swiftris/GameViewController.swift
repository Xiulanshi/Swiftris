/*In GameViewController we've added a member variable, scene. Its declaration: var scene: GameScene! lets us know that it's a variable, its name is scene, its type is GameScene and it's a non-optional value which we will assign at some point.

Swift typically enforces instantiation either in-line where you declare the variable or during the initializer, initâ€¦. To avoid this rule, we've added an ! after the type.

In viewDidLoad() we assign scene as promised, using the initializer we had just written moments ago. We tell it to fill the screen and then ask our view to present that scene to the user.
